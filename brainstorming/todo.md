I don't need to design the website now, just get a wireframe sketch of what we were talking about with Daddy so we can work more on scripting.

In other words, I want basic layout but don't need to worry about colors or pictures.

If we have all of the pages of the website like that and completely scripted then Jonathan and I can tweak the layout and take the missing pictures.

## Next Steps
* hero layout
* "the lodge-the lake-the mountains" progression
* ribbon links
* Scrolling mountains picture (not scrolling: I can do that later.)
* lots of things to do collage don't sweat it too much
* meet the team section (needs a lot of work with Daddy)
* room options section
* how to get there section
