# branding

## a site needs to serve three purposes:
* Make a user want to come
  * prevent annoyance pre first impression
  * give a *dynamite* first impression (Wow, I want to come so much)
  * confirm that impression and escalate the emotion during scrolling
  * show them how they will feel being there
  * show them the good things it will do for them
    * deepen family ties
    * mind/body/spirit recharge
      * high quality fun
      * fantastic food and lodging
      * gorgeous visual food
      * fresh, clean air
      * animals and farm
* make it as easy as possible for them to come

is it right to just speak to emotions?

## All this happens in two channels
* overt
  * text
  * illustrations
  * pictures
* subliminal
  * design
    * layout
  * pictures
  * layout

## what does a user want to feel
