# who are we?

## Not a lodge.

* A lodge is a place where you come to eat, sleep, get a massage, etc.  For example, Bowren Lakes has Becker's lodge, but the whole place isn't called Becker's lodge.  Becker's lodge is the place where you come to sleep.  (although they also happen to do canoe rental as well)


* "Lodge" implies upper-class.  It's expensive.  A family can't afford a lodge.



## Not a resort

* A family can't afford a resort either.

* Resort implies something with much more things to do.  A resort is big.  A resort costs millions of dollars to build.


## Not a farm

* A farm loses the big idea of what we're trying to accomplish.  People will think, "Why should I travel all the way down there just to visit a farm?"

## Maybe a Ranch

* A ranch implies variety.  People resonate somewhat with the idea of growing it into something that people would want to visit.
